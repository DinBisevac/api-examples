api-examples
============

Hey! This repository should be a good starting point for someone who wants to try developing apps using the QUOTE.fm API.

Currently the only example available is using libcurl and PHP, please feel free to fork this repository, add your own language and issue a pull request. If everything works as it should, we will merge it.

Please use the PHP example as reference for the complexity of your own implementation.

Thanks for your help! <3
